You can configure to launch it from your keyboard for easy access to all your favorite text snippets. You can also add and remove text from the panel with the add and remove buttons.

I wrote the application during lunch break at school, then finished it on the train to a party. It was a fun little project, I never expected it to be very useful, but every now and then I remember I have it installed and it comes to the rescue.

Later I thought about adding an emoji library to it, while that would be amazing I'm currently a bit short on time so it'll have to wait. It will happen eventually though.
